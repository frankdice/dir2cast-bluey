# dir2cast-bluey
Container-ified dir2cast to run on Bluey locally

The intention is to mount audiobooks from my local NAS, and host the Podcast to my local network to allow the use of Podcasting apps to listen to Audiobooks.

This entire project is brought to you by the work that's been done by `ben-xo`, I am just grabbing the bare minimum and replicating it here manually.

I would like to eventually use a submodule, this is currently a POC.
